#+STARTUP: overview

This is a literate Emacs config, if you're interested. The goals are neatness,
reliance on built-in features (as far as is feasible), easy extensibility, and
compatibility between GNU/Linux and MacOS.

The ~Makefile~ offers a few targets for administering (read: yak shaving) the
config:
+ ~run~ :: Run Emacs, using this directory as the init directory. Requires Emacs 29+.
+ ~retangle~ :: Tangle the code from ~roots.org~ to ~init.el~.
+ ~clean~ :: Remove the tangled ~init.el~ and ~elpa~ directory.
+ ~clean-install~ :: Clean, retangle, install packages, and native-compile elisp.
